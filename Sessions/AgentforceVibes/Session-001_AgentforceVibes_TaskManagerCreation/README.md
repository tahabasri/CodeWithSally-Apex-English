# 🧠 Salesforce Agentforce Vibes in Action! Build a Task Manager (LWC + Apex)

In this session, we put **Agentforce Vibes** into action and build a complete **Salesforce Task Manager app**.  

This video is part of the **Agentforce Vibes Series**, where we explore how to combine Salesforce development skills with the power of AI to accelerate your workflow.  

---

## 🎯 Overview

In this session, we:
- Used the same requirements introduced by **Bill Kuehler** in his Claude Code demo  
- Recreated the app step by step using **Agentforce Vibes inside VS Code**  
- Explained how to define **custom global and workspace rules**  
- Demonstrated how to ground prompts with **org metadata and local files**  
- Covered both **Plan** and **Act** modes in Agentforce Vibes  
- Generated and tested **Apex, LWC, and data scripts automatically**  
- Highlighted key lessons learned and best practices for developers

## 💡 What We Built

1️⃣ **LWC parent & child components**  
2️⃣ **Apex controller**  
3️⃣ **Apex test class**  
4️⃣ **Apex script for seeding data**

Trial 1 and 2 folders contain earlier test runs to demonstrate how AI output can vary between executions — showing that **Agentforce Vibes is not deterministic**, and output changes with context and instructions.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

1️⃣ Read the plan output carefully before executing it.  
2️⃣ If you want full control, prompt phase by phase.  
3️⃣ Review and fix generated code like a developer — AI assists, *you* perfect it.  
4️⃣ Your knowledge still matters — AI won’t replace you, it empowers you.  
5️⃣ The clearer your prompt, the better your code quality.
