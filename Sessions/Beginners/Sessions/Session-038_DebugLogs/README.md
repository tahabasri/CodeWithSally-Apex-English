## 🔍 DebugDemo Class — Demo for Understanding Apex Debug Logs

This class was used in the video [**Salesforce Apex: How to Read & Use Debug Logs for Troubleshooting?**](https://youtu.be/tPPv4VQY89k) from the **Code With Sally** beginner series.

It demonstrates key activities that appear in Salesforce debug logs and how to read them:

### ✅ What This Class Does:

- Logs custom debug messages with `System.debug()`  
- Performs a **SOQL query** to retrieve account records  
- Executes a **DML insert** operation  
- Triggers a **LIMIT_USAGE** log entry via a simple loop  
- Catches and logs a **handled exception** (division by zero)

### 🧠 Use This Class To:

- Practice reading logs in **Developer Console** or **Setup → Debug Logs**  
- Understand how different operations (SOQL, DML, Exceptions) appear in logs  
- Learn where to look for **USER_DEBUG**, **SOQL_EXECUTE_BEGIN**, **DML_BEGIN**, **LIMIT_USAGE**, and **EXCEPTION_THROWN** entries
